Individual Motivations

Project Motivation - Ashton Nicholson 

My motivation to this project is the clear point that a scheduling application is helpful in the time of mobile technology and the internet of things everything is connected, and an application can be a bridge to help organise the chaos.
I have needed to keep records of pets who where on medications and an application or web-based idea which could sync with a family member can help and is  a motivating idea to get a concept of this idea into a  working manifest.
