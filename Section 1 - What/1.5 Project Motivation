Group Motivations
----------------------

Group Therapy decide to work on Feed Me because we as group all shared a problem of ensuring our pets did not get fed multiple times and got their medications on time. Feed Me would keep the family sycned up to when a pet was last fed and when the pet next needs to be fed. 
Feed Me also provide as the ability to work on a Project that would push our current skills and build new skills to be able to build functional and visual pleasing website.

Collective Interest
----------------------
Group therapy all share an interest in make sure our pets get fed on time and do not miss important medications or get doubled dosed due to poor communication. 
We are also interested in building an application or website that can sync up between multible users, as it would add and enhance our knowledge of APIs, databases, programing languages like Java and HTML



Individual Motivations

Project Motivation - Ashton Nicholson 

My motivation to this project is the clear point that a scheduling application is helpful in the time of mobile technology and the internet of things everything is connected, and an application can be a bridge to help organise the chaos.
I have needed to keep records of pets who where on medications and an application or web-based idea which could sync with a family member can help and is  a motivating idea to get a concept of this idea into a  working manifest.

Project Motivation - Bronagh Falloon 

With six people in my family trying to coordinate who has feed or who should be feeding the dog, it can get frustrating Iâ€™m hopeful that Fed Me can help my family communicate so that the family dog gets fed on time and we can see if our dog has been fed yet.

Project Motivation - Josh Wagner

I am motivated to work on this project because I value the assitance scheduling apps provide to help keep tabs on regular tasks. Being in a large family with a dog, it would be beneficial for us to have a scheduling app to remind us if our dogs has been fed. It will be also useful for scheduling medication doses in the case our dog needs them.
