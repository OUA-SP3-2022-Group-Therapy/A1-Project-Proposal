The description should:
1. Contain enough details so that anyone with reasonable technical capability can unambiguously
visualise the proposed product.
2. Identify the type of project/stream this is: for example, a 2D Platformer, a Visual Novel or
something else.
3. Contain a detailed description of the functionality of the product (that is, what the product will do),
and enough information to give the assessor a “good feel” of the expected product experience.
