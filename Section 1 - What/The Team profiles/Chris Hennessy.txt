Background & Passion in IT.

I was born is South Australia but spent most of my early years living in country NSW and central QLD.
It wasn't until my late twenties that I found an interest  in IT and started learning to programme.
After running my own webdesign company for a few years I found software and backend programming to more interesting.

What are you good at / What youâ€™re interested in?

I have a bit of experience in a number of programming languages, from assembly and C to high level languages like Javascript
and Python. That makes it easier to understand a problem in terms of code layout. I have an interest in learning older
programming languages in the environment that they were used, as an example I had been learning x86 assembly on a
Microsoft DOS virtual machine.


What are your weak-point in the context of the project?

My weak point is working with others in a programming, IT, environment. Almost all of my programming in the past has
been by my self or with only occasional input from others.

What role do you see yourself mainly playing in the team?

I think my role will be the more on the backend programming, API, Database and overall programme structure.
