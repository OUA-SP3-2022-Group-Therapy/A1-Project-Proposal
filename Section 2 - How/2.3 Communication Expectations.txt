Action plan for unresponsive team members

-------------------------------------------------------------

1.	If a team member misses either Monday or Thursday check in

  a.	Send direct message on Microsoft teams

2.	If a team member misses both Monday check and Thursday team meeting. And the team member has not communicated that they are unable to attend

  a.	If team member does not communicate within 1 day(?) we will then email them or if we have their   phone number, we will text them directly

  b.	If by the next Monday check in the team member is still unresponsive, we will contact our mentor  for guidance

3.	If a team member has been unresponsive without prior warning for 2 weeks, we will assume they are unable complete their assigned work and re-assign their workload
