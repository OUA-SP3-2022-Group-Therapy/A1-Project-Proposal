Tools for communication

Trello will be used to allocate and track work and tasks that are assigned during team meetings. Trello will enable us to see how is responsible for each task and notice if a specific tasks has not been accidentally over looked

Microsoft Teams (MS teams) will be used for general communication; brainstorming solutions and voting when necessary to decide a course of action. MS teams will be used to decide who is responsible for a given task or role and to host the weekly pulse check in and team meeting. 

GitHub will be used for documentation and report writing, this has several benefits, firstly we can track individual contributions to the project secondly work is kept online which improves accountability, prevents team members from duplicating work, and prevents work from being lost.

SharePoint will be used to contain the master assignment document which will be the version submitted, This document will be populated from the GitHub documents and then edit as needed. 



Frequency of communication

-------------------------------------------------------------

As a team we have agreed to a twice weekly meetings on Thursdays and Mondays. The Monday pulse check will be informal and are held on the MS team’s chat, team members are expected to post at least one message. Thursday meetings are held over MS teams by video call, team meetings are expected to run for at least 40 minutes and everyone is expected to attend with camera and audio.

For communication out side of these meetings team members are expected to reply within 1 to 4 days of receiving a message. Though active participation in communication is encouraged to enable us to work together effectively 

As a team we understand we all have lives outside of uni and may have other commitments that have to take priority, when this is the case, the team expects to be informed that the team member will be unavailable and will work together to accommodate as needed.  



Weekly workflow

-------------------------------------------------------------

•	Thursday set task and goals for the week

•	Monday check in and discussion on potential issues and roadblocks
  o	Set up Trello for the week
  o	Teams’ members can notify others if they need help with their work and re-assign tasks as needed
  
  

Action plan for unresponsive team members

-------------------------------------------------------------

1.	If a team member misses either Monday or Thursday check in

  a.	Send direct message on Microsoft teams

2.	If a team member misses both Monday check and Thursday team meeting. And the team member has not communicated that they are unable to attend

  a.	If team member does not communicate within 1 day(?) we will then email them or if we have their   phone number, we will text them directly

  b.	If by the next Monday check in the team member is still unresponsive, we will contact our mentor  for guidance and began re-assgining the team members work load
  
  3. If the team member misses their third meeting without communicatio we will treat the member as leaving the team and the team will continue the assignmnet as though the team member has left unless otherwise informed
