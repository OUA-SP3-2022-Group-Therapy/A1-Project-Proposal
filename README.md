### Ashton Nicholson 

**Email:** *S3915895@Student.rmit.edu.au*

**Locale:** 


**Background & Passion in IT**

I was born in Australia and grew up in Coffs Harbour. My Hobbies include programming and gaming. My passion for IT started early with a 486 machine in which I would program in Qbasic as well as mess around to the point I deleted “autoexec.bat” that was when I set out to correct my issue, I found the passion in problem solving in IT.

**What are you good at / What you’re interested in?**

My IT interest is in programming and developing software. I have had experience in building computers, programming and am currently working as an IT Help support officer for a biometric company. I have a diploma in software development as well as a Cert III in information technology ICT

**What are your weak point in the context of the project?**

My challenges in the context of the project would be to convert a project to formats that I’m unfamiliar with this could be program specific or technique such as how to implement a feature or design in the task.

**What role do you see yourself mainly playing in the team?**

The specific type of task I can see myself contributing is some programming knowledge, design ideas as well as general input and encouragement to the task at hand.

### Bronagh Falloon - s3965252:

**Email:** S3965252@student.rmit.edu.au

**Locale:** 

**Background & Passion in IT**

My name is Bronagh Falloon, I was born in New Zealand my family moved to Australia when I was a year old (I still have my kiwi accent somehow), I was homeschool with my three siblings for all of my schooling until I started a cert IV in healthcare after completing the cert IV I did two year of a bachelor's degree in Nursing. 
I’ve always had an interested in IT after I wiped the OS from the family mac (fun times) as a child. I’ve been the go-to person in my family for tech-support for years to so I decided to try and make a job out of it.

**What are you good at / What you’re interested in?**

After completing intro to programming I feel confident with python (just don’t ask me what a for loop does) and okay with HTML and CSS. I am interested in expending my knowledge and abilities in writing code. I have done art and drawing as a hobby for a few years now, I am confident with visual design and making things look pretty.

**What are your weak point in the context of the project?**

My weak points would be general knowledge on how to use other programming languages and using tools like git hub and Trello. I believe also being less familiar with the actual process of building websites and applications would be a weak point.

**What role do you see yourself mainly playing in the team?**

I imagine the role I will be taking is design the visual aspect of the website and building the website.
